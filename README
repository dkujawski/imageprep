i have this little digital picture frame thing that uses a usb stick as storage.
many of my images are HUGE! the usb stick is not HUGE. and the digital picture frame only has a screen resolution of 640 anyway.
so, i wanted a tool that i could point at a dir tree of images, resize the image and put them into a flat directory.
often there were dup file names, so i want to use md5 hashes for the names to keep them unique.
